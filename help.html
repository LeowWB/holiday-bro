			<h1>Copy everything in the table, including the table headers. DO NOT COPY THE BLUE ROW AT THE TOP (the one that says "Partner University to NUS..."). Note that it's okay if your table headers are different from the ones in the image - the parser will work fine as long as you get all the table headers.</h1>
